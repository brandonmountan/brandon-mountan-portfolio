# brandon-mountan-portfolio

## Description

    The motivation behind building this project was to create a unique portfolio that can ultimately be used in the future when applying for jobs. This project was built because I wanted to use the skills I have learned thus far and challenge myself to create a great portfolio website for myself. A great portfolio is a major key to success in my future endeavors. I learned how to start a website from scratch and most importantly, what goes into making a unique portfolio.
